    <h1>English</h1>
    <p>
      English is as important in day to day life as in the exams if not more.
      Learning English helps you to understand other areas of the exam like
      understanding instructions and will help with communicating if you get a
      job and have to move to other states where the native language is
      different from your mother tongue.

      It also helps you find more and more valuable resources across the
      internet that will help you in your studies like
