    <h1>Mathematics</h1>
    <p>
      “If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because
      they do not realize how complicated life is.” — John von Neumann,
      Mathematician and Computer Science Pioneer

      Maths isn't as scary as you think if you are willing to learn, relearn and
      unlearn. Recommended study pattern is to learn the basics and learn the
      steps to solve a problem the long method then once you are comfortable
      with that pratice using the shortcut methods. Jumping directly to the
      shortcut way might not be sustainable.

    <p>
      From analysing your personal cash flow to understanding Large language
      models(LLMs), maths gonna help you. It's also a great way to exercise your
      brain.
